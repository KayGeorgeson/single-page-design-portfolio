## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned

This was the first time I really tried using flexbox and CSS grid. Also this is my first time trying to use Sass rather than just plain CSS.







### Continued development

Overall this has been a very positive experience learning wise and highlighted all the things I need to do in my next project as to not make the same mistakes.

I feel I probably, looking back on it, should have started with a mobile first approach and will do this with my next project. I also did not introduce Sass until the end, so could have gone more indepth with it regarding better nesting and such.

I also think maybe the CSS stylesheet is too long and I should have broken things up into different stylesheets.

I was trapped in 'tutorial hell' with react, so this is my first time trying it without the hand-holding and I feel maybe the slide-scroller I created with it might be a bit clunky.








### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This fun game helped me get to grips with flexbox.
